    "Pearson, it’s defined in the following way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s define our data set to be kept in a matrix, $\\mathbf{Y}$ with $p$\n",
    "columns. We assume that $\\mathbf{ y}_{:, j}$ is the $j$th column of that\n",
    "matrix which corresponds to the $j$th *feature* of the data. Then\n",
    "$y_{i,j}$ is the $j$th feature for the $i$th data point. Then the sample\n",
    "mean of that feature/column is given by $$\n",
    "\\mu_j = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^ny_{i,j}\n",
    "$$ where $n$ is the total number of data points (often refered to as the\n",
    "sample size in statistics). Then the variance of that column is given\n",
    "by,[1] $$\n",
    "\\sigma_j^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_{i,j} - \\mu_j)^2.\n",
    "$$ The covariance between two variables can also be found as $$\n",
    "c_{j,k} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_{i,j} - \\mu_j)(y_{i, k} - \\mu_k).\n",
    "$$ If we normalise this covariance by the standard deviaton of the two\n",
    "variables ($\\sigma_j, \\sigma_k$) then we recover Pearson’s correlation,\n",
    "often known as Pearson’s $\\rho$ (the Greek letter rho), $$\n",
    "\\rho_{j,k} = \\frac{c_{j,k}}{\\sigma_{j} \\sigma_{k}}.\n",
    "$$ Computing the correlation between two values is a way to determine if\n",
    "the values have a relationship with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems of statistics, is that when we are working with\n",
    "small data, an apparant correlation might just be a statistical\n",
    "anomally, i.e. a conicidence, that arises just because the quantity of\n",
    "data we have collected is low. In mathematical statistics we make use of\n",
    "hypothesis testing to estimate if a given statistic is “statistically\n",
    "significant”.\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical hypothesis testing, we define a *null hypothesis*. This is\n",
    "a hypothesis that contradicts the idea we’re interested in. So for\n",
    "correlation analysis, the null hypothesis would be “there is no\n",
    "correlation between the features $i$ and $j$”. We then measure the $p$\n",
    "value. The $p$ value is the probability that we would observe a value as\n",
    "extreme as the one we see if the null hypothesis is true. If this value\n",
    "is low (typically below 0.05 or below 0.01 depending on how stringent we\n",
    "want to be) we *reject the null hypothesis* and the statistic is\n",
    "declared to be significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing gives us critical values of the correlation\n",
    "coefficient that we need to believe that there is a relationship between\n",
    "the variables. Those values get smaller as $n$ gets larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] sometimes the formula used uses $\\frac{1}{n-1}$ instead of\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{n}$. This can be motivated by the observation that this\n",
